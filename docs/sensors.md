| GPS tracker       | [Yes](code/mega/src/GPS.cpp)                                     | Latitude and longitude coordinates.      | Plan the hiking trail and make sure to follow a wheelchair accessible path. Track your results and progress in terms of distance and speed. Link data gathered through the other sensors with locations for later use (feedback or sharing with other users) |
