## Context

Most people walk in their day-to-day lives. To work, school, to a restaurant with some friends, or just to your friendâ€™s desk a few steps over. As we think about it, walking is a purely functional endeavour, design to get you from A to B in the quickest, most efficient way. There is however another way of walking, one that more and more people are practicing every day. One where the important matter is not the destination but the journey: **hiking**.

Hiking is an enjoyable activity with both physical and mental benefits. Hiking outdoors is a stimulating activity that helps decreasing stress levels and increase creativity and happiness. But we want not for these benefits to be limited by the ability to walk. People who have movement disabilities and are wheelchair-bound nevertheless do have the ability to enjoy journeys through nature. With our project, we want to contribute to **make hiking more enjoyable and safe for these wheelchair-bound people, without the need to be accompanied by an able-bodied person**.
